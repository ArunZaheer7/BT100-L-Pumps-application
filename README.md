# BT100-L-Pumps-application

It is especially developed for BT100-L water pumps widely used in water waster management Projects/Researches.

Reason for Development:

Company which created those pumps is no longer updating the application, because the application is quite simple.

Major problems Users face:

Application can take multiplie Hexacommands but user has to run each querry mannuelly , because there is no execution time functionality implemented.

Users have to create hexa commands mannuelly separately in excel file.

Problem resolved:

Application can take multiplie Hexacommands; now hexa commands can be sent to the same or different pumps connected in a series automatically, because there is execution time functionality implemented.

Users will not have to create hexa commands in a separate excel sheet, and then enter in to the application. Instead user can generate hexa commands of pumps within the software application

Import/Export facility is also implemented to avoid generating hexa commands again and again; intead they can use exported commands.(That is a time saver functionality).
